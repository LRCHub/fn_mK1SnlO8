I will be kind
Wont be so cruel

I will be sweet
I will be true

The pains of love

You quickly learn

Are soon to hate
And quick to burn

I gott a brand new seth of rules
Because i am your brand new fool

I gott a brand new seth of rules i gott to learn

You be so proud
So proud of me
You see the change so clear to see
Because of you a brand new start
Because of you a change of heart

I gott a brand new seth of rules
Just like i was back in school

I gott a brand new seth of rules
I gotte learn

Im gonne change
Just mark my words
You can belive in al thoose word you heard
