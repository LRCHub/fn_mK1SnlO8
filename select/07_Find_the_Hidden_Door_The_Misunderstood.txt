Cast your giant shadow, my way
Cast it over me, I will stay
Find the hidden door, it will show you the way

Cast your giant shadow, lost in eternal light
Let all my love and hidden truth, melt into liquid night
Find the hidden door
Find the hidden door

Open your virgin eyes, you will see
The truth that's lost with in you, and you'll be
Complete in mind and soul and forever live free

Cast your giant shadow, lost in eternal light
Let all my love and hidden truth, melt into liquid night
Find the hidden door
Find the hidden door
