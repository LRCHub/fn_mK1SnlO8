Clear summer day
You became the prey
You gave your best defense
Your smile was just pretense

You want to shout, nothing comes out
A shadow blocks the sun
Where does that day live
Where part of you did drown?

Hidden away down
Hidden away down deep inside
Didn't the day drown?
Didn't the day drown in the night?

You're running away now
You're running away till the morning light
A criminal take down
A criminal take down with no fight

Pretend confidence
Keep the beast at bay
Like a fugitive
It's you yourself you blame

Sparrow sing the morning in
You feel the light of day
Can the promise of redemption
Reach that place?

Hidden away down
Hidden away down deep inside
Didn't the day drown?
Didn't the day drown in the night?

You're running away now
You're running away till the morning light
A criminal take down
A criminal take down with no fight

The world breaks everyone
And after which you will find some
Stronger in their broken parts
In the wild mountain of their hearts

Love can mend a broken soul
But who can trust a heart not whole
Waiting for the wounds to close
In that dark place

Hidden away down
Hidden away down deep inside
Didn't the day drown?
Didn't the day drown in the night?

You're running away now
You're running away till the morning light
A criminal take down
A criminal take down with no fight

You're running away now
You're running away till the morning light
A criminal take down
A criminal take down with no fight
